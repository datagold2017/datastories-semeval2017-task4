This repository contains the source code for the models used for _DataStories_ team's submission for SemEval-2017
Task 4 “Sentiment Analysis in Twitter”.

At the moment the repository is a placeholder and contains only the code for the models and _not_ a complete working example.
You can find the Attention Layer's code in https://github.com/cbaziotis/keras-utilities/blob/master/layers.py.

I will upload a complete end-to-end example, soon.
